# Smart printing service

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Student Smart Printing Service (HCMUT_SSPS) for serving students in HCM University of Technology's campuses to print their documents.

## Tech stack we used
Our project was built with [React](https://react.dev/) library for the frontend based on the foundation of [Material design](https://m2.material.io/design/introduction), [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) + [Google Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) for the backend, and deployed with [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

### Why React?
We used React in our application development process because it is very easy to learn, has large eco-system and support, and the speed of iterations is high due to the fact that the library is component-based, which allows us to quickly try new ideas and functionalities without having to change much existing works.

### Why Firebase and its additional services?
We used Firebase in our project because aside from its feasibility to connect and use its underlying database system, Firebase also provides us with Authentication APIs and free hosting service, with a rich set of tools and APIs for us to customize specifically to our needs, making the infrastructure part of our project much less a headache.
